# Flask Routing Project

This Flask project demonstrates the basics of web routing and template rendering. The application consists of three pages â€” Home, About, and Contact â€” each accessible through its own URL route (/home, /about, /contact).

Routing in Flask works by associating URL paths with Python functions using the @app.route() decorator. When a user visits a particular URL, Flask calls the linked function and returns the corresponding HTML page rendered from the templates folder. This setup enables creating multi-page web applications with clean, organized code.
